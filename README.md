# Kernighan-Lin-algorithm
to implement the Kernighan-Lin algorithm for the graph partitioning problem, this algorithm considering the problem of partitioning the nodes of the graph with costs on its edges into subsets of given sizes to minimize the sum of the costs on all edges cut. We can using this algorithm to get the minimize number of connections of the circuits on the boards. I use C++ to implement this algorithm.
Using UCI Testbench
